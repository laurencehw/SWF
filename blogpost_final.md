# America Needs a Sovereign Wealth Fund—But Only If We Bind Our Own Hands

For decades, Washington viewed sovereign wealth funds as anomalies—artifacts of petro-states and mercantilist regimes that hadn't yet learned the virtues of efficient markets. That era is over. With over $12 trillion in sovereign assets globally, state capital is no longer a market distortion; it *is* the market. China's Belt and Road has deployed over $1 trillion in strategic investments across 140 countries. The US response? A truncated Development Finance Corporation, a sector-specific CHIPS Act, and an Ex-Im Bank that can't make equity investments. We've brought a spork to a knife fight.

In February 2025, President Trump signed an executive order calling for a US sovereign wealth fund—building on work that had been percolating in the Biden administration's bureaucratic sub-basement. The bipartisan interest is real. So is the risk that any fund becomes a vehicle for executive patronage and precinct-level pork.

**The central challenge isn't whether to create such a fund. It's whether we can design institutional architecture that prevents Washington from being Washington.**

I've spent the past year working through what a credible proposal requires. The full white paper is now available. Here's the essential architecture:

**Structural separation solves the slush-fund problem.** The proposal creates two distinct accounts: a Strategic Investment Account (60%) for international investments in critical minerals, supply chains, and allied infrastructure—modeled on Singapore's GIC—and a Domestic Development Account (40%) requiring private co-investment, closer to Temasek's approach. The wall between them prevents domestic political pressure from overwhelming geopolitical objectives.

**Congressional statute, not executive order.** Constitutional-level asset protection, mandatory 10-year reauthorization, and a supermajority requirement for major investment decisions. An independent federal corporation structure—think the Fed, not a cabinet agency.

**On funding, we must abandon the fantasy of tariff fairy dust.** The US runs deficits; pretending otherwise is unserious. The proposal outlines phased funding: $50 billion initial appropriation, then dedicated revenues (mineral royalties, spectrum auctions), eventually strategic asset monetization—including portions of the SPR and underutilized federal real estate. The underlying logic is a sovereign carry trade: borrowing at Treasury rates to invest in higher-yield strategic assets where the spread justifies the cost.

The geopolitical reality is this: a well-designed fund could compete with Chinese capital, secure supply chains, and generate long-term returns. A poorly designed one would be worse than nothing. In institutional architecture, structure dictates behavior. We can do this—but only if we're willing to bind our own hands.
