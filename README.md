## Executive Summary

This white paper proposes a detailed architecture for the **United States Strategic Investment Fund (USSIF)**—a sovereign wealth fund designed to advance American economic and national security interests while maintaining the highest standards of governance and transparency.

### Key Proposal Highlights

| Element | Proposal |
|---------|----------|
| **Target Size** | $300-500B by Year 10; $500B-$1T by Year 30 |
| **Initial Capitalization** | $50 billion congressional appropriation |
| **Structure** | Dual-account (Strategic 60% / Domestic 40%) |
| **Governance** | 9-member board with independent majority |
| **Compliance** | Full Santiago Principles adherence |

### The Problem

- China has deployed **$1+ trillion** through Belt and Road Initiative
- Gulf states and Singapore leverage hundreds of billions in sovereign wealth
- US lacks comparable tools for strategic capital deployment
- Existing programs (DFC, Ex-Im Bank, CHIPS Act) are insufficient in scale and flexibility

### The Solution

A well-designed sovereign wealth fund that:
- Competes with adversary-nation strategic capital
- Secures critical supply chains and minerals
- Catalyzes domestic infrastructure investment
- Generates long-term returns for the American people
- Maintains robust governance against politicization
